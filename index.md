I'm just getting started with this.

See also [the Leek Group's guide to data sharing](https://github.com/jtleek/datasharing),
the [Data Carpentry](http://datacarpentry.org/)
[lesson on using spreadsheets](https://github.com/datacarpentry/excel-ecology),
and [Hadley Wickham](http://had.co.nz/)'s [paper on tidy data](http://www.jstatsoft.org/v59/i10/paper).

Eventually, I'll cover topics like these:

- Be consistent.
- Fill in all of the cells.
- Make it a rectangle.
- Create a data dictionary.
- Make it a tidy data set.
- No calculations in the raw data files.
- Make backups.
- Name files meaningfully.
- Use Excel features to avoid data entry mistakes.
- Things not to do.
