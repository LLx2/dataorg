I'm just getting started with this.

Eventually, I'll cover topics like these:

- Be consistent.
- Fill in all of the cells.
- Make it a rectangle.
- Create a data dictionary.
- Make it a tidy data set.
- No calculations in the raw data files.
- Make backups.
- Name files meaningfully.
- Use Excel features to avoid data entry mistakes.
- Things not to do.
