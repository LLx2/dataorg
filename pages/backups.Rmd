- make regular backups
- consider using a formal version control system, like
  [git](https://git-scm.com).
- keep all versions of the data files, so that if something gets
  corrupted (e.g., you accidentally type over some of the data without
  noticing it), you'll be able to go back and fix it.
- When you're not actively entering data, write-protect the file.
  (Include screen shots on Mac and Windows. Can you do this within excel?)
