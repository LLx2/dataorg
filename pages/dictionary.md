Have a separate file that explains what all of the variables are.
- Exact name as in the data file
- A longer name that might be used in data visualizations
- An explanation
- Units
- Minimum and maximum values, perhaps

information *about* the data. You'll also want a `ReadMe` file that
includes an overview of the project and data.
