- variables and files
- no spaces in names
- refer ahead to the discussion of data dictionaries (or "code books")
- Never include "`final`" in a file name. You'll invariably end up
  with "`final_ver2`".
- Be careful about extraneous spaces (say, at the beginning or end of
  a variable name). "`glucose`" is different from "`glucose `" (with
  an extra space a the end). Extraneous spaces can cause headaches
  later.
