title: Use data validation to avoid errors
description: "Data organization: Use data validation to avoid errors"

I don't have much experience with data entry. (Well, there was
[that one time](http://kbroman.org/FruitSnacks), but it hardly counts.)
And so I can't give much advice about how best to ensure that the
process is as error-free and repetitive-stress-injury-free as possible.

But one thing that seems potentially useful is the
["data validation" feature](https://support.office.com/en-nz/article/Apply-data-validation-to-cells-c743a24a-bc48-41f1-bd92-95b6aeeb73c9)
in Excel, to control the type of data or the values that users can
enter into a cell.
