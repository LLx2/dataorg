When you're talking about formatting dates, you've got to lead with
this [xdcd](https://xkcd.com/1179/) comic:

Excel does
[crazy things with dates](https://storify.com/kara_woo/excel-date-system-fiasco). It
stores them internally as an integer, counting the days since
1900-01-01. Wait that's only for Windows; on Macs, it counts the days
since 1904-01-01.

So, be careful to check that the dates haven't been mangled when your
data come out of Excel.

Excel also has a tendency to turn other things into dates:

Personally, I'd be inclined to use a plain text format for columns in an Excel worksheet
that are going to contain dates, so that it doesn't do anything to them:

- Select the column
- In the menu bar, select Format â†’ Cells
- Choose "Text" on the left

Alternatively, you could create three separate columns with year,
month, and day. Those will be ordinary integers, and so Excel won't
mess them up.

But really what I wanted to emphasize here: be consistent in the way
in which you write dates. And really, always use the `YYYY-MM-DD`
format, as in the [xkcd comic, above](https://xkcd.com/1179/) (or
put the year, month, and day in separate columns, if you want).

I have an old Excel spreadsheet in front of me that looks a bit like
this:

```{r bad_dates}
mat <- data.frame(Date=c("", "", "12/6/2005", rep("", 4)),
                  "Assay date"=c("12/9/05", "12/9/05", "e", "e", "e", "1/11/2006", "1/11/2006"),
                  "Weight"=c(54.9, 45.3, 47, 45.7, 52.9, 46.1, 38.6),
                  stringsAsFactors=FALSE, check.names=FALSE)
excel_fig(mat, direct2svg=TRUE, cellwidth=90)
```

I don't quite remember what those `e`'s were for, but having
different date formats within a column can cause headaches later.

Use care about dates, and be consistent.
