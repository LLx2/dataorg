Keep a copy in a plain text format, with comma or tab delimited.
I generally use comma-delimited (CSV) files.

To save an Excel file as a comma-delimited file:

- From the menu bar, File â†’ Save As
- Next to "Format:", click the drop-down menu and select "Comma Separated Values (CSV)"
- Click "Save"
- Excel will say something like, "This workbook contains features that will
  not work...". Click "Continue".
- Quit Excel. It will ask you, "Do you want to save the changes you
  made?" Click "Don't Save", because you just saved them.
