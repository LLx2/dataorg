## Source for pages

- Only edit the `.Rmd` files in this directory.
- The `.md` files are built from the `.Rmd` files with
  [knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/).
- Only some of the `.Rmd` files include [R](https://www.r-project.org)
  code (to make figures), but I thought it'd be simpler to use `.Rmd`
  for all of the pages rather than just those with figures.
